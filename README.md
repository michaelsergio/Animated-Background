Instructions
=================
Run the animated_background.py script.

It will scrape Reddit's /r/spaceporn and download the images into your home directory under a new folder called .redditbackgrounds.

It will then create an xml file in that directory containing the slideshow and automatically set it.

This has not been tested on anything except:
* Ubuntu 12.04

This script requires BeautifulSoup4 which can be installed with

`pip install BeautifulSoup4`

If you want to change the source, feel free to edit the script.
Please keep the url set to only Reddit's SFW porn images or otherwise change the User Agent.




Feel free to contribute any additional features!
